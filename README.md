# Data Science Project: car price prediction

The following project consists in one scenario in which we will have to analyze and train a model for one data set. The data set contains information about year, price, transmission, mileage, fuel type and engine size of a specific used cars that have the same brand and model. The idea is training a model to predict which will be the price of a used car in the market.

Steps:

1.	Upload the csv file to the workspace and load it into a data frame.
2.	Look for null values and outliers. Remove, keep or impute them and explain why.
3.	Show the main statistics (mean, standard deviationâ€¦) of the numerical columns of the data set. Are any of the variables skewed?
4.	Train a model for the prediction of the price. Explain why I chose the model that I have trained.
5.	Test the model and obtain some performance metrics from it. Does it have a good performance? Why?
6.	Would you say that you have enough information to predict the price of an Electric Vehicle of the same class? Why?

Used Technologies:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
